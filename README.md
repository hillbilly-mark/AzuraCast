This is cloned to customize azuracast a bit for my own needs.  

My main goals here are:
* bettter proxying
* direct icecast usability
* removal of so many unused ports

I am very clueless at this point about how to even start.  I have never put or developed anything on GitHub before.  I expect this project to take a large amount of time to accomplish.  There will be a learning curve on my end.

I highly recommend that you use the Azuracast from the original developer, instead.
